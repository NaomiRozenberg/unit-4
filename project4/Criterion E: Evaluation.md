**Beta Testing and Evaluation**

To assess the application and gauge potential consumer reactions, I conducted a beta test. This involved inviting external users to test and evaluate the application. Using external testers, rather than those involved in the development process, provides unbiased feedback, resulting in more accurate and valuable insights. 

Below are the results of the survey conducted with these beta testers.

**Evaluation of Results and Future Improvements**

After analyzing the information, I have identified areas for improvement to maximize the user experience of the application. The following enhancements should be considered for the next update:

1. **Visualization Enhancements**: Improve the front-end visualization for following/unfollowing forums and people, as well as liking/unliking posts.

2. **User Experience (UX)**: Address general UX issues to make the application more intuitive and user-friendly.

3. **Image Upload Feature**: Add the option to upload pictures to posts and comments. A tester noted that this would significantly improve the application.

4. **Direct Messaging (DM)**: Introduce the option for direct messaging with other users to enhance communication within the application.
